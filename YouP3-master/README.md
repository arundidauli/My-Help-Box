### Help
It's not hard to use it.Basic mode is just supereasy. In advanced mode, there will be some choices saying `dash`.. actually dash files are videos without audios. As sometimes higher resoliution videos are only in dash, I've thought to merge them with audio. Looking further whatever I can do. Till then don't use `dash` if you don't require.

Also, it's not complete yet. There might exists fatal bugs which I've not faced, I'll love to have an issue created by you then.
